/*
LETS THINK ABOUT THE BOARD:
starts w/back
then 4 colored slide pieces
- the 2nd of these has 6 coming off of it. the last being "home"
- the 4th of these has one coming off of it, being "start"
then 4 black
then 5 colored slide pieces
then 1 black

TYPES OF BUTTONS:
start
home base, leading to home
slide
black
